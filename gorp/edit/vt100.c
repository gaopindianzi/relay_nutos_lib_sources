/*!
 * \brief Optional VT100 key mapping routine.
 *
 * Pass this function to \ref EdLineRegisterKeymap to enable VT100
 * key mapping.
 *
 * This routine has been tested with the TeraTerm terminal emulator
 * after loading the keymap contained in ibmkeyb.cnf. It allows to
 * use the arrow keys for moving the cursor and walking through
 * the history. This should work with most other VT100 emulations as 
 * well.
 *
 * The following command sequences are remapped:
 *
 * - ESC [ A remapped to \ref EDIT_KEY_UP.
 * - ESC [ B remapped to \ref EDIT_KEY_DOWN.
 * - ESC [ C remapped to \ref EDIT_KEY_RIGHT.
 * - ESC [ D remapped to \ref EDIT_KEY_LEFT.
 *
 * Internally calls \ref EdLineKeyMap to handle carriage return and 
 * linefeed.
 *
 * \param key Input character to remap.
 * \param seq Pointer to an integer, which is used by the key mapping
 *            routine to store the current state. Note, that its value
 *            must be preserved by the caller between calls to 
 *            \ref EdLineRead.
 *
 * \return The mapped character. If \ref EDIT_KEY_IGNORE is returned
 *         the caller must ignore this character.
