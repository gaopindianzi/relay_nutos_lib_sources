This directory contains prepared project files for Ethernut 2 with 
ICCAVR Version 7. They can be used to compile the samples within the 
source tree. However, since Nut/OS 3.9 the recommended method is
to use the Configurator to create a new sample directory outside
the source tree. The Configurator will create modified project files
with corrected include and library paths.
