 * This is the runtime initialization for the AT91SAM7SE256 with code
 * loaded into external RAM. It uses the same code as all members of
 * the AT91SAM7SE family. However, the Configurator requires a CPU
 * specific file name that is related to the CPU specific linker script.
 * Thus, we simply include the shared code of all family members here.
