 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.4  2008/08/11 07:00:23  haraldkipp
 * BSD types replaced by stdint types (feature request #1282721).
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/04/18 13:31:59  haraldkipp
 * Changed size parameter from uint16_t to int, which is easier to handle
 * for 32-bit targets. You need to recompile your ARM code. No impact on
 * AVR expected
 * I changed u_int to int at some places to avoid some warnings during
 * compilation of Nut/Net.
 * libs.

 * Revision 1.2  2005/04/05 17:39:56  haraldkipp
